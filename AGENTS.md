# Repo AGENTS.md

This file adds repo-specific policy on top of the global AGENTS guidance.

## Repo Identity

The canonical repo and product name is `spoke`.

When writing or updating docs, reviews, Epistaxis notes, PR text, release notes, or other outward-facing references for this repo, use `spoke` rather than `donttype` or `dictate`.

Treat the repo as renamed for documentation purposes and keep naming consistent with `spoke`.

## Commits

Unless the user explicitly says otherwise, push commits after creating them.

## Smoke-test branch launches

When the user asks to spin up a separate fun or smoke-test branch, treat that as a request to launch the dedicated worktree for that branch rather than the stable default launcher path.

Before launching that branch:
- pull or otherwise update the target branch/worktree
- kill the currently running Spoke process
- relaunch from the target worktree's launcher script

Do not silently fall back to the stable Automator or `main` launcher when the user explicitly asked for the branch variant.
